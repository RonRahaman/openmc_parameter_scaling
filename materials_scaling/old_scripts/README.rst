Contains old scripts for generating/running materials scaling.  

generate_materials.py
  An old script for generating models with fewer nuclides based on the large hm
  model.  May not be as accurate as materials_lib_mitcrpg.

set_matlib.sh
  An old script for setting up the settings directories for a single run of
  OpenMC.  Need to fix this to use the materials in materials_lib_mitcrpg
